# microservice-approach-to-building-a-monolithic-application
 i love the way micro services are meant to be designed. the fact that the service does not care about otside world and is able to hold and work its logics is amazing.
 the fact that it can be attached to any database resource and can also be attached #easily# to a contoller with different platforms to frontend portal is nothing shot of fantastic.
 
 and as such thought i could build and design monolithic app based on microservice architecture.
